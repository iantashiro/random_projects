# 🧪 Random Data Science Projects

This repository contains a collection of exploratory and predictive data science projects, built on diverse real-world and synthetic datasets. The goal is to apply modeling techniques, data visualization, and domain knowledge while I transition into a data science role.

## 🚧 Purpose

I'm currently transitioning into a career in data science. These projects serve as a way to:
- Practice modeling, visualization, and analysis
- Explore interesting or niche datasets
- Build a portfolio for job applications

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- Python (Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebooks
